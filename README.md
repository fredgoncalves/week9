# week9

Summary: 

I want to build facade panels that react to solar light by changing the surface permeability to let more or less light go through. I will use light sensors and potentially temperature sensors to drive the movement in the panels being able to create a gradient of opacity and also a ornamental surface.

Component Parts: 

Panels (fabric, plywood or acrylic)
Panels Frame (metal, plywood or acrylic)
Structure to move the panels parts (nitinol wire, threads, laser cutted plywood or acrylic)
Stepping Motor?
Light Sensor
Temperature Sensor
Arduino board

Challenges:
To create and refine the motion in the panel.


Project Timeline: 

week 1
finish the panel design + start testing its response using arduino, firefly, grasshopper + order components
week 2
fabricate  one panel + test it in real life with the real components
week 3
fabricate more panels + refine design and programming
week 4
fabricate final panels and frame
week 5
put everything together
